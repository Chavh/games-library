<h1>Games Library</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Games Library app, a demo project that showcases my knowledge in building full-stack web applications using Vue.js, Python, Flask, and PostgreSQL. The app allows users to browse and search for games, add games to their wishlist, and submit reviews for games.</p>

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: Vue.js
- Backend: Python, Flask
- Database: PostgreSQL

## Features
- Browse and search for games
- Add, delete and update games info to the library.
- TODO: Admin functionality to add, edit and delete games
- TODO: User Roles, permissions etc

## Getting Started
To run the app locally, you will need to have Node.js, Python, Flask and PostgreSQL installed.

- Clone the repository: ```git clone https://github.com/Chavh/games-library.git```
- Install the frontend dependencies: ```cd games-library/frontend and npm install```
- Install the backend dependencies: ``` cd ../backend and pipenv install```
- Create a .env file in the backend folder with the following:
- DATABASE_URL=postgres://[username]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[dbname]
- SECRET_KEY=[yoursecretkey]

Run the backend server: ```pipenv run python app.py```
Run the frontend server: ```cd ../frontend and npm run serve```
The app should now be running on http://localhost:8080
