<h1>Games Library</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Games Library app, a demo project that showcases my knowledge in building full-stack web applications using Vue.js, Python, Flask, and PostgreSQL. The app allows users to browse and search for games, add games to their wishlist, and submit reviews for games.</p>

## Tech Stack

## Getting Started
To run the app locally, you will need to have Node.js, Python, Flask and PostgreSQL installed.

- Clone the repository: ```git clone https://github.com/Chavh/games-library.git```
- Install the frontend dependencies: ```cd games-library/frontend and npm install```
- Install the backend dependencies: ``` cd ../backend and pipenv install```
- Creating and running the db: ```cd db ``` then run the install script ```./install 127.0.0.1 <port> postgres gamesdb -c```
  when prompted enter your password,

Run the backend server: ```pipenv run python app.py```
